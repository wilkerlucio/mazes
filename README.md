# Mazes Playground

This repository contains my experiments while reading the book
[Mazes for Programmers](https://pragprog.com/book/jbmaze/mazes-for-programmers), it's a really great
reading and I recommend to everyone.

The implementation here is made using ClojureScript, and React (with Om), if you wanna build it you gonna need
the Leinigen build tool, after install it run `lein figwheel` to start the compilation and the development server,
after that you can see it running at `http://localhost:3449`.
